# Specification Quality Checklist: Fix Dashboard Data Pipeline

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Spec includes a detailed JAR output inventory (sections 1-23) verified against actual v3.2.2 output from running the JAR against error_logs/log1.log
- Problem statement includes root cause mapping for all 10 dashboard sections
- Assumptions section documents discovered format details (### headers, not === headers)
- All items pass validation. Ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
